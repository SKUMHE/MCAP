# About MCAP #
### We at BitcoinGrowthFund have launched a token called MCAP. Our token uses the ERC 20 protocol for peer-to-peer transactions. All MCAP transactions will be recorded to the Ethereum Blockchain to ensure immutability and transparency.
BitcoinGrowthFund has planned to release a total of 100 million tokens and has only released 20% of the MCAP tokens as of now. The remaining 80% will eventually be released in the coming months.
## Where will the funds be invested? ##
The funds raised from the sale of MCAP tokens will be invested in various mining projects and other ICOs.<br />
Mining: Mining is a process where clients offer the computational power of their systems to record data onto the Blockchain. For each successfully uploaded transaction, the miners are rewarded with a small portion of newly created coins.
We at BitcoinGrowthFund have realised the potential profits which can be generated from mining and have developed an algorithm to calculate which AltCoin would be most profitable to mine at any given moment based on its difficulty level, trading volume and the profit it would generate.<br />
ICO: Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is the latest development in the market to raise funds for projects where companies raise money through tokens to invest in other avenues.
## MCAP follows ERC 20 Protocol ##
After rounds of meetings and iterations we decided to switch to ethereum protocol. But the question is why so much hustle. Following points will help us answer this question:
The ERC20 standard provides out-of-the-box interoperability with a wide variety of wallets and tools.
Ethereumâ€™s smart contract platform can be leveraged to build a more robust and decentralized storage system.
Future integration with Ethereum opens exciting opportunities to provide data services to smart contracts and Dapps.
We will participate in a larger community of protocol maintainers, sharing the ERC20 tokens have been issued by a number of prominent projects including Augur and Golem, and have wide support in the Ethereum development community. 
## Use Myether Wallet to request withdrawals ##
We will now be using a new wallet for our token namely <a href="http://www.myetherwallet.com"> "myether wallet"</a>. The wallet is easy to use.Mist can be used as a simple wallet to send and receive payments, but it requires users to run a full node and it takes a while to sync. If you want to create a new wallet without having to download the blockchain or simply haven't done so in a long time and don't wish to download a big part of it, you can simply use the web based application, MyEtherWallet.
